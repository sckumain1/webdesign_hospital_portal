<font color="#000000">
<p><h3>ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:</h3> This is the name given to the doctor who has completed training and is in charge of your care. An attending physician might supervise a team of medicalstudents,residents,and fellows which means that he or she may bring other people on rounds to visit patients.</p>

<p><h3> HOSPITALIST:</h3>Hospitalists are attending physicians who only care for patients who are in the hospital.These doctors don&apos;t have officeswhere they see patients.Sometimes pediatricians and family doctors have hospitalists care for their patients while they are in the hospital.A hospitalist will stay in contact with your regular doctor but will manage your treatment while you&apos;re in the hospital.</p>


<p><h3>DOCTOR ON CALL:</h3> Your doctor can&apos;t work all the time. The doctor on call is a physician who covers weekends, evenings, and other shifts when your doctor can&apos;t be there.Doctors on call are there to answer questions and cover emergencies.\n</p>

<p><h3>FELLOW:</h3>A fellow has completed medical school and residency training, and is getting additional training in a particular specialty, such as heart surgery or kidney problems.</p>

<p><h3>RESIDENT:</h3> A resident is a doctor who has graduated medical school and is now training in a specific field.Doctors spend from 3 to 7 years in residency training before receiving board certification in their specialty.Residents can care for patients in a teaching hospital,but they are supervised by attending physicians who must approve their decisions.</p>

<p><h3>MEDICAL STUDENT:</h3>Medical students (who are training to be doctors) usually spend the first 2 years of medical school in the classroom and the last 2 years seeing patients in a hospital setting.</p>

<p><h3>PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT(PA):</h3> A physician assistant works under the supervision of a doctor.He or she examines patients,diagnoses and treats simple illnesses,orders tests,looks at test results,provides health care counseling,assists in surgery,and writes prescriptions.Most PAs have a college degree and have completed a special 2-to 3-year training program."
